0
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.760
我们从矢量乘标量开始。
 We begin with multiplication of a vector by a scalar.

1
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.420
当你乘向量a时
 When you multiply a vector a

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.100
通过标量，这个乘法因子只是重新缩放向量的大小或长度。
 by a scalar, this multiplicative factor just re scales the magnitude or the length of the vector.

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.660
让我们看向量两次
 Let us look at the vector two times a

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
这与向量a的方向相同，但长度是向量a的两倍。
 this is in the same direction as the vector a but is twice as long.

5
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.240
这是向量b
 This is vector b

6
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.260
矢量由其大小和方向来定义。所以这个向量b在空间的任何地方都是一样的，包括在原点。
 a vector is defined by its magnitude and direction. So this vector b is the same anywhere in space, including at the origin.

7
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.350
如果我要负点乘以5，这个向量是b的反方向，是长度的一半。
 If I want minus point five times be, this vector is in the opposite direction of b and is half the length.

8
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.670
现在让我们看看向量加法。
 Now let's look at vector addition.

9
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.660
这里是向量a，这里是b，我们如何用图形方式添加它们？
 Here's a vector a here is b how do we add them graphically?

10
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.840
我们把b的尾巴滑到a的头上
 We slide the tail of b to the head of a

11
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.940
它们的和是从a的尾部到b的头部的向量
 and their sum is the vector drawn from the tail of a to the head of b

12
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.400
我也可以把a的尾部滑动到b的头部来增加a到b
 I could have also added a to b by sliding the tail of a to the head of b

13
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.360
你可以看到这是一个平行四边形，一些向量c
 you can see that this makes a parallelogram, and the some vector c

14
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.210
只是这个平行四边形的对角线。
 is just the diagonal of this parallelogram.

15
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.480
是 啊。
 Yeah.

16
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.500
减法可以看作是乘法和加法。
 Subtraction can be thought of as just multiplication and addition.

17
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.080
如果c等于a减去b
 If I have c is equal to a minus b

18
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.920
我只需要把a加到向量减去b
 I just need to add a to the vector minus b

19
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.920
负b是负的1乘以b
 minus b is negative one times b

20
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.480
这就是向量。
 which is this vector here.

21
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.380
现在我只需要把a加到-b
 Now I only have to add a to minus b

22
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.580
再举一个例子
 let's do another example

23
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.150
在这里。我的向量a和b不是从原点开始的。但是由于矢量在空间的任何地方都是一样的，我可以在这里进行这个过程。
 here. My vectors a and b do not start at the origin. But since vectors are the same anywhere in space, I can go through the process here.

24
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.740
我要a减b
 I want a minus b

25
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.320
所以我先乘以我的负1，得到负b
 so I first multiply be my minus one to find minus b

26
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.400
然后我移动了负β的尾部
 and then I moved the tail of minus beta, the head of a

27
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.480
把这两个加起来。
 and add the two like this.
