00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.280
在这里，我们将学习如何区分向量。并按比例
 Here, we will learn to distinguish between vectors. And scale as

1
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.680
向量是同时具有一个数量级和一个数字的对象
 vectors are objects that have both a magnitude, a single number

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.000
还有方向，
 and direction,

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.220
而比例尺只有一个量级。
 whereas scale as have only a magnitude.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.250
让我们看看每个例子。
 Let's see some examples of each.

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.550
某物的长度是标量，
 The length of something is a scalar,

6
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.530
因为这只是数量级，
 because it's just the magnitude,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.460
拉力某人拉动某物所施加的力量
 a force exerted by someone pulling something

8
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.630
是一个向量，
 is a vector,

9
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.880
因为我们关心力量的力量，
 because we care about the strength of the force,

10
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.960
大小，
 the magnitude,

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.850
以及力的作用方向
 and the direction in which the forces acting

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.760
温度。
 temperature.

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.570
这是一个定标器。
 It's a scaler.

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.130
如果我们在天气图上显示温度，
 If we display temperature on a weather map,

15
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.950
在空间中每个点的温度值不同的地方，
 where the value of the temperature is different at each point in space,

16
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.690
这是一个标量场
 this is a scalar field

17
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.680
相比之下。
 in comparison.

18
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410
这张风的天气图，
 This weather map of wind,

19
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.730
或者空间中每个点的风速值，
 or the value of the wind velocity at each point in space,

20
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.640
由矢量表示
 is represented by a vector

21
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.990
是一个向量场。
 is a vector field.
